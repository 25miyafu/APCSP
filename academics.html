	<p>A highlight from the school year was getting an A on a test. A down of this school year was that it rained a lot. An up of this school year is that it was fun.

		In math I learned the quadratic formula. In history I learned about the industrial revolution. In APCSP I learned how to code using python. In chemistry I learned about avogadros number and mols. In spanish I learned lots of new words. In English I learned parts of speech and how to use them. In financial literacy I learned about stocks.
